## Deeplearning-in-IoT-systems
### *Master's Project @University of British Columbia*
---
### Objective of Project: 

- **Analysis**: Evaluation of the current state of the art of IoT architecture and Deep Learning systems followed by an
analysis of the use of Deep Learning and IoT technologies in union to improve existing IoT architecture
- **Implementation**: Demonstration of the proposed idea by applying sequence analysis using RNNâ€™s on temporal
time series sensor data to perform human activity recognition to assist smart home system to adapt to the dynamic
environment and deal with noise better
